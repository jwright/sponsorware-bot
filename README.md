## DESCRIPTION

sponsorware-bot is a GitHub app built with [Probot](https://probot.github.io/) that automates any action based on activity from your GitHub Sponsorship.

## INSTALLATION

Any GitHub user can install the [Sponsorware Bot GitHub App](jwright/sponsorware-bot). During the installation process, you will be asked for access to some of your repositories. You will want to provide access to your private Sponsorware repositories so that sponsorware-bot execute actions against those repositories.

After successfully installing the Sponsorware Bot, the user will be redirected to a URL with further instructions on how to update their sponsorship url. The instructions will provide a link for them to create a new webhook for their sponsorship (i.e. `https://github.com/sponsors/<github-username>/dashboard/webhooks/new`) with the proper payload url and secret.
